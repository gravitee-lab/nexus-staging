= Upgrade to 3.6.0

=== Elasticsearch

With Elasticsearch version above 7.x, `geoip` and `user_agent` plugins are automatically enabled.

=== APIM API

Two new configuration keys have been added, they should be set with the URLs of UI App and Management API either:

 - By updating the `gravitee.yml` file:
```yml
console:
  ui:
    url: gravitee_apim_ui_url # TO UPDATE WITH YOUR OWN URL
  api:
    url: gravitee_apim_management_api_url # TO UPDATE WITH YOUR OWN URL
```

 - By using environment variables:

```shell
console_ui_url=gravitee_apim_ui_url ←️ TO UPDATE WITH YOUR OWN URL
console_api_url=gravitee_apim_management_api_url ←️ TO UPDATE WITH YOUR OWN URL
```

NB: If you are using Cockpit these URLs are requred as they will be used to navigate between Cockpit and APIM.
